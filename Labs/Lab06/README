1. The similarity calculation involves a summation for ‘all products that both users have provided ratings for’. How have you handled finding this set of products?

    1. Find the average from each row. Skip when it is -1 and keep counting how many times you have added.
    2. When you compare the same item from both users, if either one is -1, then skip. Otherwise, we update ouor denominator and numerator
    3. divdie the numerator by the denomoinator to get sim(a,b)

2. How have you tried to minimize the runtime complexity of your implementation? Are there any other values you think could be pre-computed or that you could avoid recomputing many times? How?
