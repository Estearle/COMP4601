This lab is more efficient as we have taken into account pre-calculating values.
Specifically, we have precalculated the averages and the similarity scores.
Similarly to the previous lab, we have an input parameter for neighbourhood sizes.
This is for calculating the predicted scores such that the number of similarities scores taken into account can be changed.
