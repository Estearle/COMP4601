1. How did you generate the adjacency matrix from the crawled data? 
We connect to the database /lab3.
Adjacency matrix: 
    1. Initialize the matrix of zeros with 1000 x 1000
    2. Mapping the titles to indices (titleToIndex)
    3. Filling the adjacency matrix: Iterate through each document outgoing links,update the adjacency matrix with 1 at (titleToIndex[currentPage], titleToIndex[outgoingLink])
    4. Calculate the number of 1s in each row and update the 1 into 1/count. If a row has no 1s, the row is filled with 1/len = 1/1000
transition matrix = adjacency matrix *(1-a) + m * a, while a = 0.1 and m is a 1000*1000 matrix filled with 1/len(1/1000)

2. What effect would lower/higher alpha values have on the results?
The alpha value is used to represent the how random it is to go from one page into another without having 
an outgoing link to it. 
A higher alpha value converges faster. This means that as alpha approaches 1, then the outgoing links 
matter less and all pages tend to have closer equal PageRank values.
Conversely, a lower alpha value converges slow. This means that as alpha approaches 0, there is more weight
to outgoing links between the pages and pages with more incoming links are ranked higher.
